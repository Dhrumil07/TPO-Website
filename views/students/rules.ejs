    <h2><u>Regarding PPOs</u></h2>

    <h5>For BTech, MTech & MCA:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>All companies are requested to release their PPO offers by the end of July, as the Final
                Placement process starts from 1st August each year. [TPO will remind the companies, and
                the students are also requested to do the needful from their end, and remind their
                respective companies].</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If a student wants to reject a PPO, they should discuss this with their company before the
                final PPO offers are declared by the company.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Once a student gets a final PPO, it will be considered that the student has been placed in
                that company.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The student can reject the PPOs which are having CTC less than 12 Lakhs. But this rejection
                must be done immediately.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The student can immediately reject any final PPO, if he/she wants to go for higher studies
                or off-campus placement. But this rejection must be done immediately. Also, the student
                will be debarred from sitting for further campus process.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>For BTech only:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>If a student gets a final PPO, he/she is counted as placed and will have only one attempt left
                to apply for betterment in final placement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If a student rejects a PPO of CTC < 12 Lakhs, he/she has to compulsorily accept the offer of
                the very next company that he/she gets placed in (the new company can be from any
                category). There will be no further betterment option available.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

<div>
    <h2><u>Regarding Placement: Categorisation of Companies and Application to
        Better Category</u></h2>

    <div>
        <strong>Note: Categorization and Betterment is available only for the B.Tech Students and NOT for
            M.Tech and MCA Students.</strong>
    </div>

    <p>This year onwards, we aim to categorise companies into 3 types, based on their CTC:</p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
        <tr>
            <th>Category</th>
            <th>CTC Range (in INR)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Normal</td>
            <td>&#60 20 lakhs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Dream</td>
            <td>&#8805 20 lakhs &#38 &#60 40 lakhs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Super-Dream</td>
            <td>&#8805 40 lakhs</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <div>
        <p>To provide the best placements to the students, according to their preference, TPO will allow
            students to apply in companies of better category, even after being placed. However, the switch
            (getting placed in a company of better category) is restricted to one time only.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h6>Example:</h6>
        <p>A student gets placement in company PQR [Normal].
            Now, they can still apply to Dream and Super-Dream companies. (Rule: Application to better
            category is allowed)
            If they get selected in company LMN [Dream], then they are out of the placement process, and
            cannot apply to any other company, even of the Super-Dream category. (Rule: Switch to any other
            better category is restricted to one time only)
            They will be finally placed in LMN [Dream].</p>

        <p>If a student is waitlisted (or there is a delay in result declaration) by company ABC and later
            he/she gets a job in some other company PQR, and then if the company ABC gives an offer then
            student will have a choice to decide between ABC and PQR. But, that will be counted as a
            betterment switch and then the student cannot apply for betterment after that.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <h2><u>Regarding Off-Campus Offers and Higher Studies</u></h2>
    <div>
        <p><strong>The students who are placed via on-campus drive, will have to compulsorily join the company (for
            at least 1 year).</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Strict action</strong> (including blocking of transcript) will be taken against students who violate this rule.</p>
        <p>The students who aspire to go for Higher Education / Off Campus placement cannot apply for
            On-Campus Placements.</p>
        <p>If a student is taking part in the campus process, and has not got a final offer from anywhere, then
            he/she can quit the campus process, and then go for off-campus or higher studies.
            If a student was applying for off-campus or higher studies, but was unsuccessful, then he/she can
            join the campus process. However, he/she needs to assure and give in writing that he/she will not
            go for any higher studies or off-campus offers.</p>
